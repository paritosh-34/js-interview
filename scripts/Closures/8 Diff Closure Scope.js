// Diff b/w closure and scope

// Whenever you create a function within an other function, then the inner function is the closure.
// (which is usually returned, so we can use the outer function's variables later)

// Scope defines what variables you have access to.
// There are 2 kinds of scope - global scope, local scope.

// In closure there's always 3 scopes:
// global scope, outer scope, local scope
